      <p>llama.ttf is a font file which is also a large language model and an inference engine for that model.</p>
      <h3>Ehm, what?</h3>
      <p>llama.ttf is a font file which is also a large language model and an inference engine for that model.</p>
      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <h3>How?</h3>
      <p>
        The font shaping engine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HarfBuzz">Harfbuzz</a>, used in applications such as Firefox and Chrome,
        comes with a <a href="https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/blob/main/docs/wasm-shaper.md">Wasm shaper</a> allowing arbitrary code to be
        used to "shape" text.
        
        <br /><br />
        In particular, this "arbitrary" code could in principle be an entire LLM inference engine, relying on treating text containing magic symbols for fake "ligatures" to initialize the LLM and use it to generate text.
        <br /><br />
        It could also in principle be an entire LLM inference engine (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llama_(language_model)">Llama</a> in our case,
        hence the name) but not instead of in principle it's right here.
        <br /><br />
        At the end of the day, what this means is that you can just use the font to run the LLM and e.g. get text generation in <i>any</i> Harfbuzz-based text editor,
        even if they don't come with "Copilot" like features themselves. So is this silly hack in fact a billion dollar idea?
      </p>
      <h3>Okay show me</h3>
      <p>Yeah, sorry, that was brief. Here's an attempt to make it make more sense:</p>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q4bOyYctgFI?si=XAAcj3uf02vxdXwM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>Skip to 6:09 if you just want to see the font in action.</p>
      <h3>Usage</h3>
      <p>Just download <a href="https://github.com/fuglede/llama.ttf/raw/master/llamattf/llama.ttf">llama.ttf</a> (60 MB download, since it's based on the 15M parameter TinyStories-based model) and use it like you would any other font. Use it somewhere where Harfbuzz is used and built with Wasm support.</p>
      <h3>More fun with fonts</h3>
      <p>If this didn't seem pointless enough, here are some other weird things people have done with fonts and LLMs:
        <ul>
          <li>tom7's Super Metroid speedrun documentation-inspired language for formatting text nicely with LLMs: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y65FRxE7uMc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y65FRxE7uMc</a></li>
          <li>Erk's presentation on programmable fonts with Harfbuzz-Wasm, very much an inspiration for this one: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms1Drb9Vw9M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms1Drb9Vw9M</a></li>
          <li>A completely playable Pok√©mon-inspired game inside a font: <a href="https://www.coderelay.io/fontemon.html">https://www.coderelay.io/fontemon.html</a></li>
