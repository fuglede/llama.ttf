      <p>llama.ttf is a font file which is also a large language model and an inference engine for that model.</p>
      <h3>Ehm, what?</h3>
      <p>llama.ttf is a font file which is also a large language model and an inference engine for that model.</p>
      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <h3>How?</h3>
      <p>
        The font shaping engine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HarfBuzz">Harfbuzz</a>, used in applications such as Firefox and Chrome,
        comes with a <a href="https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/blob/main/docs/wasm-shaper.md">Wasm shaper</a> allowing arbitrary code to be
        used to "shape" text.
        
        <br /><br />
        In particular, this "arbitrary" code could in principle be an entire LLM inference engine (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llama_(language_model)">Llama</a> in our case,
        hence the name).
        <br/><br />
        It could also in principle be an entire LLM inference engine but not just in principle, relying on treating text containing magic
        symbols for fake "ligatures" to initialize the LLM and use it to generate text.
      </p>
      <h3>Okay show me</h3>
      <p>Yeah, sorry, that was brief. Here's an attempt to make it make more sense:</p>

      <p>Skip to 6:09 if you just want to see the font in action.</p>
      <h3>Usage</h3>
      <p>Just download <a href="https://github.com/fuglede/llama.ttf/raw/master/llamattf/llama.ttf">llama.ttf</a> and use it like you would any other font. Use it somewhere where Harfbuzz is used and built with Wasm support.</p>
